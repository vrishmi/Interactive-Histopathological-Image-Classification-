# Interactive Histopathological Image Segmentation

## Introduction
Digital pathology allows us to capture, manage, and share information from digitized tissue samples in a digital environment. This offers many benefits, including remote image interpretation and further use of samples for scientific research. Histopathological image classification is crucial in medicine and biomedical research, providing vital insights into various diseases and conditions.

- **Early Disease Detection**: These images give detailed information about tissue structures and cellular abnormalities, helping to detect diseases like cancer, infections, and autoimmune disorders early. Accurate classification can lead to timely interventions and better patient outcomes.

- **Precision Medicine**: Advanced image classifiers help healthcare professionals tailor treatment strategies based on individual patient characteristics. This personalized approach ensures effective treatments, minimizes side effects, and optimizes therapeutic outcomes.

- **Research Advancements**: Image classification is essential for biomedical research, aiding in the discovery of disease markers, understanding disease mechanisms, and developing new treatments. Analyzing large datasets of these images helps researchers find patterns and insights that advance medical science.

## Features
- **Accurate Segmentation**: Uses state-of-the-art algorithms to accurately segment histopathological images, achieving 90% accuracy.
  
- **Image Preprocessing**: Includes steps like normalization, noise reduction, and stain normalization to prepare images for segmentation. 
  - **Customizable Training Pipeline**: Allows customization of parameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

- **Overlay Visualization**: View segmentation results overlaid on original images for easy comparison.
  - **Interactive Visualization**: Tools to zoom, pan, and adjust transparency of segmented regions.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading images, running segmentation, and viewing results.
